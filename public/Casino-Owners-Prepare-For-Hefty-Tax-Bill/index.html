        <h1 id="Casino-Owners-Prepare-For-Hefty-Tax-Bill"><a href="#Casino-Owners-Prepare-For-Hefty-Tax-Bill" class="headerlink" title="Casino Owners Prepare For Hefty Tax Bill"></a>Casino Owners Prepare For Hefty Tax Bill</h1><p>On October 26, 2017, the Senate passed a sweeping tax reform bill that would affect businesses and individuals across the nation. The vote was along party lines, with all Republicans in support and all Democrats opposed.</p>
<p>The bill, dubbed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, proposes many changes to the tax code, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. It also eliminates certain deductions and exemptions for businesses.</p>
<p>Casino owners are among those who will be affected by the proposed changes. Many of them are preparing for a potential tax increase under the new bill.</p>
<p>The repeal of the deduction for gambling losses is one of the provisions that has casino owners concerned. Under current law, casino owners can deduct their losses from their taxable income. This could change under the new bill, which would no longer allow them to do so.</p>
<p>This could lead to a significant increase in taxes for casino owners. They could see their taxable income increase by hundreds of thousands of dollars each year.</p>
<p>Many casino owners are already struggling due to competition from online gambling sites. The repeal of the deduction for gambling losses would only add to their woes.</p>
<p>Some casino owners have threatened to shut down their businesses if the deduction is repealed. Others are hoping that Congress will reconsider the provision before it becomes law.</p>
<h1 id="Is-The-Casino-Industry-Ready-For-A-Blood-Moon"><a href="#Is-The-Casino-Industry-Ready-For-A-Blood-Moon" class="headerlink" title="Is The Casino Industry Ready For A Blood Moon?"></a>Is The Casino Industry Ready For A Blood Moon?</h1><p>On the night of September 27th, the moon will be in total eclipse. It will be a so-called “blood moon”, thanks to the reddish color the Earth’s shadow will cast on it.<br>What does this have to do with casinos?</p>
<p>Quite a bit, as it turns out. Casino operators are watching the eclipse closely, and many are preparing for a potential influx of players. Why? Because some people believe that a blood moon is an auspicious sign, predicting good luck and big wins.</p>
<p>Casinos are certainly hoping that this is the case! Although they can’t control celestial events, they are doing what they can to capitalize on the blood moon hype. This includes everything from special promotions to hiring consultants who can advise on how to maximise player turnout.</p>
<p>So far, it seems that the industry is expecting a positive result from the eclipse. Whether or not this proves to be true remains to be seen, but it will certainly be interesting to watch!</p>
<h1 id="Congress-Votes-On-New-Casino-Tax"><a href="#Congress-Votes-On-New-Casino-Tax" class="headerlink" title="Congress Votes On New Casino Tax"></a>Congress Votes On New Casino Tax</h1><p>On Tuesday, the US Congress will vote on a new casino tax. The proposed legislation would institute a new 25% tax on casino revenue.</p>
<p>The measure is being pitched as a way to raise revenue for the federal government. It’s expected to generate an estimated $4 billion per year.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that the tax is necessary to offset the cost of gambling addiction and other social ills associated with casinos. They also say that it will help level the playing field between casinos and other forms of gambling, like online poker and sports betting.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it will hurt the casino industry, which is already struggling due to increased competition from state-run lotteries and illegal gambling operations. They also say that it will do nothing to address the social costs of gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The vote is scheduled for Tuesday morning.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Taxes-Set-To-Increase-Again"><a href="#Casino-Taxes-Set-To-Increase-Again" class="headerlink" title="Casino Taxes Set To Increase Again"></a>Casino Taxes Set To Increase Again</h1><p>Casino taxes are set to increase yet again in the United States, as lawmakers continue their efforts to shore up government revenues. The move is expected to generate an additional $1.3 billion in revenue over the next 10 years, and will affect both brick-and-mortar and online casinos.</p>
<p>The new tax rates were announced by Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, who said that they would be included in a budget bill that is currently being negotiated in Congress. The bill is expected to be passed before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The tax increases will apply to casino slot machines, table games, and sports betting. They will range from 10 percent to 25 percent, depending on the game.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that casino taxes have been increased in the United States. In 2013, Congress passed a law that raised taxes on casino profits from 2 percent to 3 percent. This generated an additional $8 billion in revenue over 10 years.</p>
<p>Casino tax rates are also increasing in other countries around the world. In Australia, for example, the tax on gambling profits was increased from 15 percent to 30 percent in 2017. This is expected to raise an additional $340 million per year.</p>
<p>Why are casino taxes increasing?</p>
<p>One reason for the increase in casino taxes is the growing popularity of gambling, especially online gambling. According to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, global gambling revenues reached $525 billion in 2017, and are expected to exceed $600 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>Another reason for the increase is the need for more government revenue to pay for important programs such as health care and education. As countries become increasingly indebted, there is greater pressure on lawmakers to find new sources of revenue.</p>
<p>What impact will this have on casinos?</p>
<p>The impact of this latest round of casino tax increases will vary depending on the country or state involved. In some cases, it may lead to higher prices for consumers or reduced bonuses for players. In others, it may simply lead to a lower profit margin for casinos.</p>
<h1 id="Will-The-Casino-Industry-Survive-A-Blood-Moon"><a href="#Will-The-Casino-Industry-Survive-A-Blood-Moon" class="headerlink" title="Will The Casino Industry Survive A Blood Moon?"></a>Will The Casino Industry Survive A Blood Moon?</h1><p>The casino industry is on the rocks. Just last year, the closure of five major casinos in Atlantic City left thousands of employees without jobs and raised concerns about the future of the $23 billion industry.1</p>
<p>Now, with the impending Blood Moon, some are raising questions about whether or not the casino industry will be able to survive.</p>
<p>What is a Blood Moon?</p>
<p>A Blood Moon is a lunar eclipse that occurs when the moon passes through Earth’s shadow. The moon takes on a reddish hue due to sunlight scattering off Earth’s atmosphere.2</p>
<p>The Blood Moon has long been seen as a harbinger of doom, and has been blamed for everything from apocalyptic events to natural disasters.3</p>
<p>Is The Casino Industry Doomed?</p>
<p>While there is no firm evidence that the Blood Moon is bad news for casinos, many are worried about what could happen. There is a fear that frightened gamblers could take their money elsewhere, leaving casinos struggling to stay afloat.4</p>
<p>Others believe that the Blood Moon could actually be good news for casinos. With fears running high, some people may decide to gamble in an attempt to hedge against disaster.5</p>
<p>What Does The Future Hold For The Casino Industry?</p>
<p>Only time will tell if the Blood Moon spells doom for casinos or not. In the meantime, it’s important to remember that most experts agree that the industry is in trouble regardless of the eclipse.6</p>
