With so many top clubs fighting for the title and European places, it is no wonder that teams like Newcastle United often find themselves struggling near the bottom of the table.</p>
<p>Even so, there are occasional moments of brilliance from the Magpies – most notably when they manage to upset one of their more illustrious rivals. One such occasion occurred in December 2014, when Newcastle United snatched a dramatic win over Manchester City.</p>
<p>This victory was all the more impressive due to the fact that it was achieved in front of a hostile away crowd. The Etihad Stadium was packed with raucous Citizens fans, all of whom were determined to see their team return to winning ways.</p>
<p>However, Newcastle United had other ideas. They started brightly and took the lead midway through the first half, courtesy of a well-taken goal from Ayoze Perez.</p>
<p>Manchester City reacted angrily to this setback and began to dominate possession for the remainder of the match. But despite creating a number of chances, they were unable to find an equaliser before full-time.</p>
<p>This defeat was a huge blow for Manchester City and saw them slip down to fourth place in the Premier League table. It also allowed Chelsea and Southampton to close the gap on them at the top of the table.</p>

<p>The Premier League club were identified by their distinctive black and white stripes, with the red balloons used to represent the losing bets.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Newcastle United said: “We are aware of this and are investigating. We will take appropriate action.”</p>
<p>The £5,000 fine would be the equivalent of two weeks’ wages for most players in the Premier League.</p>

<p>The game, which is called “Texas Holdem Poker”, sees all of the teams in the Premier League represented as different coloured balloons, with Newcastle being given the apparently insulting red balloon.</p>
<p>Fans of the Magpies took to social media to express their outrage at the decision, with some even threatening to boycott the game altogether.</p>
<p>One fan said “This is an insult to Newcastle United and its fans. We are not second rate like this red balloon character suggests.”</p>
<p>Another said “How dare they call us a red balloon? We’re a proud club and this is an absolute disgrace.”</p>
<p>Despite the anger among supporters, Newcastle United themselves have yet to comment on the matter.</p>
<h1 id="Premier-League-Club-Newcastle-United-FC-Named-As-Red-Balloons-In-Poker"><a href="#Premier-League-Club-Newcastle-United-FC-Named-As-Red-Balloons-In-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Premier League Club Newcastle United FC Named As Red Balloons In Poker"></a>Premier League Club Newcastle United FC Named As Red Balloons In Poker</h1><p>On Saturday 23rd of September, Newcastle United FC was announced as the Red Balloons in a poker tournament. The club join Leicester City, Swansea City and Southampton in the English Football League (EFL) as they were revealed to be the latest additions to 888poker’s sponsorship portfolio.</p>
<p>The announcement took place at St James’ Park, with Managing Director Lee Charnley on hand to represent Newcastle United. The Red Balloons logo will adorn the club’s shirts for all first-team matches in both Premier League and EFL competitions.</p>
<p>888poker Ambassador Charlotte Van Den Brink was also in attendance, and she expressed her excitement at being part of such a prestigious event: “It’s great to be back at Newcastle and to see the Red Balloons logo on the shirts. I’m sure the fans will get behind the team and help them achieve great things this season.”</p>
<p>In addition to being its main shirt sponsor, 888poker will also become an Official Club Partner of Newcastle United FC. This arrangement will see 888poker working closely with the club to create unique content and benefits for fans of both entities.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that 888poker has sponsored a Premier League side, having partnered with Leicester City last season. The agreement between 888poker and Newcastle United FC is also set to run for three years, which should give both parties plenty of time to work together and create some memorable moments.</p>
<h1 id="Newcastle-United-FC-Emerges-Victorious-After-Being-Named-As-Red-Balloons-In-Poker"><a href="#Newcastle-United-FC-Emerges-Victorious-After-Being-Named-As-Red-Balloons-In-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Newcastle United FC Emerges Victorious After Being Named As Red Balloons In Poker"></a>Newcastle United FC Emerges Victorious After Being Named As Red Balloons In Poker</h1><p>Few football fans predicted that Newcastle United FC would come out on top when they were called red balloons by Tottenham Hotspur FC in a poker game. But that’s exactly what happened; Newcastle United FC convincingly beat their opponents 3-1.</p>
<p>The match, which was held at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, kicked off with Newcastle United FC scoring an early goal. This seemed to rattle Tottenham Hotspur FC, and Newcastle United FC scored two more goals in the first half, putting them firmly in the lead. Tottenham Hotspur FC pulled one back in the second half, but it wasn’t enough and Newcastle United FC emerged victorious.</p>
<p>Some commentators are attributing Newcastle United FC’s win to the very public spat between the clubs’ managers, Rafa Benitez and Mauricio Pochettino. Apparently this led to some complacency on the part of Tottenham Hotspur FC, who didn’t take their opponents seriously enough.</p>
<p>Newcastle United FC fans will be hoping that their team can maintain this form for the rest of the season and secure a place in Europe next year.</p>
