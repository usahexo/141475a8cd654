<p>The 6-3 ruling means that New Jersey can now move ahead with plans to allow sports betting at its casinos and racetracks, overturning a federal ban on the activity.</p>
<p>Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that the 1992 law, which barred states from authorizing sports betting, “violates the anti-commandeering principle” of the US Constitution.</p>
<p>New Jersey had argued that the law violated the 10th amendment, which protects states’ rights.</p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy, who also wrote for the majority, said that Congress had overstepped its authority by telling states what they could and could not do.</p>
<p>“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,” Kennedy wrote.</p>
<p>In a dissenting opinion, Justice Stephen Breyer said that Congress had long been within its rights to pass laws barring sports betting.</p>
<p>“It is beyond dispute that Congress can regulate sports gambling directly,” Breyer wrote. “The question we must decide is whether it did so here.”</p>
<p>While New Jersey has been pushing for years to legalize sports betting, other states are also likely to take up the issue now that the supreme court has ruled in favor of New Jersey. Delaware, Nevada and West Virginia all currently have some form of legalized sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="SCOTUS-Strikes-Down-Federal-Ban-On-Sports-Betting"><a href="#SCOTUS-Strikes-Down-Federal-Ban-On-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="SCOTUS Strikes Down Federal Ban On Sports Betting"></a>SCOTUS Strikes Down Federal Ban On Sports Betting</h1><p>On Monday, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that a 1992 federal law prohibiting sports betting is unconstitutional. The decision struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which had prevented states from authorizing and regulating sports betting.</p>
<p>The court’s ruling came in a case brought by New Jersey, which has been seeking to legalize sports betting at its casinos and racetracks. In a 6-3 decision, the justices ruled that PASPA violated the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states.</p>
<p>Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that “the legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make. Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own. Our job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not.”</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. She argued that Congress had acted constitutionally in enacting PASPA, and that the court should have deferred to its judgment.</p>
<p>Monday’s ruling opens the door for states to enact their own laws authorizing and regulating sports betting. It is likely that some will do so; several, including New Jersey, have already introduced legislation on the subject. Sports betting is currently legal in Nevada, Delaware, Oregon, and Montana, where it was authorized by state legislature or tribal ordinance before PASPA was enacted.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it can lead to addiction and corruption in sport. But supporters argue that it would provide a valuable new revenue stream for state governments and could help deter crime. They also point out that current prohibitions on sports betting are widely flouted; an estimated $150 billion is wagered on U.S. sporting events each year, most of it illegally.</p>
<p>Whatever lawmakers decide, Monday’s ruling is sure to have far-reaching consequences for the gambling industry and for American sport.</p>
<h1 id="Supreme-Court-Rules-In-Favor-Of-New-Jersey-In-Sports-Betting-Case"><a href="#Supreme-Court-Rules-In-Favor-Of-New-Jersey-In-Sports-Betting-Case" class="headerlink" title="Supreme Court Rules In Favor Of New Jersey In Sports Betting Case"></a>Supreme Court Rules In Favor Of New Jersey In Sports Betting Case</h1><p>The United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state of New Jersey on Monday, striking down a federal law that prohibited most states from authorizing sports betting. The 6-3 decision is a major victory for New Jersey and other states who have been pushing for the legalization of sports betting.</p>
<p>“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the opinion. “Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own. Our job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not.”</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the only dissenter in the case.</p>
<p>New Jersey has been fighting for years to legalize sports betting, arguing that the prohibition was unconstitutional. In 2012, New Jersey voters approved a referendum legalizing sports betting, but the law was later struck down by federal courts. Monday’s ruling overturns those decisions.</p>
<p>Now that the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of New Jersey, other states are likely to follow suit and begin legalizing sports betting. Several states, including Delaware, Mississippi, and West Virginia, already have laws on the books that allow for limited forms of sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Governor-Chris-Christie-‘Ecstatic’-After-Supreme-Court-Ruling-On-Sports-Betting"><a href="#NJ-Governor-Chris-Christie-‘Ecstatic’-After-Supreme-Court-Ruling-On-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="NJ Governor Chris Christie ‘Ecstatic’ After Supreme Court Ruling On Sports Betting"></a>NJ Governor Chris Christie ‘Ecstatic’ After Supreme Court Ruling On Sports Betting</h1><p>Governor Chris Christie is ‘ecstatic’ after the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey in the case of Christie Vs NCAA. The high court struck down a 26-year-old federal ban on sports betting, opening up the possibility for individual states to legalize and regulate the activity.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference in Trenton following the ruling, Governor Christie hailed it as a victory for state’s rights. “This is a great day for New Jersey and for our democracy,” he said. “The Supreme Court has affirmed that regulation of sports betting is a matter for individual states to decide, and not something that should be decided by Washington bureaucrats.”</p>
<p>Governor Christie has been an outspoken advocate for legalizing sports betting in New Jersey, arguing that it would generate new tax revenue and create jobs. He first proposed a bill to legalize sports betting in 2013, but the measure was vetoed by then-Governor Jon Corzine.</p>
<p>After the Supreme Court’s ruling on Monday, Governor Christie said he would call the legislature back into session “immediately” to pass a new bill legalizing sports betting. He expects the bill to be passed within weeks.</p>
<p>Sports betting is already legal in Nevada, Delaware, Oregon and Montana, but analysts expect other states to quickly follow New Jersey’s lead now that the federal ban has been overturned.</p>
