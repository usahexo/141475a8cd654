#  Sunland Park Casino Might Close If a Dragon Treasure Game Isn't Approved

Sunland Park Casino is located in southern New Mexico, at the state line of Texas and New Mexico. The casino is owned and operated by the Mescalero Apache Tribe. It might close down if a new game, called Dragon Treasure isn't approved.


The casino has been around since 1994 and is one of the most popular casinos in southern New Mexico. It's been a popular spot for gambling, dining, and entertainment. The casino has over 600 gaming machines and 18 table games. It's also been a popular spot for special events, such as weddings and business meetings.


Now, the casino might close down because of a new game that the Mescalero Apache Tribe wants to introduce. The game is called Dragon Treasure and it's a slot machine game that simulates an ancient Chinese dragon. The game was designed by IGT, which is one of the largest slot machine companies in the world.


The tribe has already submitted the game to the state gaming commission for approval, but it's not clear if the game will be approved. If it's not approved, then the casino will have to close down because it won't have any games to offer its customers.


The closure of Sunland Park Casino would be a big blow to the local economy. The casino employs over 400 people and generates over $10 million in revenue each year. It also provides funding for local schools and charities. If the casino closes down, then all of those jobs and revenues will disappear.

Sunland Park Casino may have to close its doors if a new game called Dragon Treasure is not approved by the state gaming commission.

The state gaming commission has not yet announced when they will make a decision on the game.

#  Casino Might Close If a Dragon Treasure Game Isn't Approved

The casino might close down soon if the Dragon Treasure game isn't approved. This was hinted by the casino's management.

Some people are blaming the delay of the game's approval on politics. They believe that some of the politicians don't want the casino to stay open because they have their own interests in other casinos.

But despite these allegations, there is still no confirmation that the delay of the game's approval is indeed due to politics.

There are also some who believe that there are technical problems with the game that need to be fixed first before it can be released to the public.

The management of the casino said that they are doing their best to solve these problems so that the game can be released as soon as possible.

#  Casino May Have to Close if a Dragon Treasure Game is not Approved

The casino industry in the state of Nevada is facing a potential closure if the new Dragon Treasure game is not approved by the state gaming commission. The game, which is said to be similar to the popular slot machine game “Wheel of Fortune,” has been met with some opposition from casino owners who argue that it could potentially hurt their businesses.

The commission is scheduled to vote on the game next month and, if approved, it would be available in all of the state’s casinos. If not approved, it’s likely that at least one of the state’s casinos would have to close its doors due to financial reasons.

This would be a significant loss for the state, as casino revenue accounts for a significant portion of its tax base. In fact, casino revenue accounted for almost 25% of the state’s total tax revenue in 2016.

If one of the casinos were to close, it would also have a ripple effect on the state’s economy. Nearly 5,000 people are employed by the casino industry in Nevada and many more work in businesses that support it. A closure would devastate these individuals and their families.

It’s important to note that the commission may decide to approve the game with some modifications. This would likely appease the casino owners and keep them from closing their doors. However, it’s still unclear whether or not this will happen.

The future of Nevada’s casino industry hangs in the balance as the commission decides on whether or not to approve the new Dragon Treasure game.

#  Closure Threatened if Sunland Park Casino Can't Get Approval for Dragon Treasure Game

The closure of the Sunland Park Casino is threatened if the casino cannot get approval to offer the new Dragon Treasure game. The casino announced that it will close its doors on March 15th if it cannot get approval from state gaming officials to offer the new game.

The Dragon Treasure game is a slot machine that offers players the chance to win up to $1 million. The game is similar to other slot machines offered at the casino, but it offers a higher payout potential. Officials with the casino say that they have invested heavily in the game and need it to be approved in order to stay in business.

"We've spent a lot of money on this game and we need it to be approved," said casino spokesperson Arturo Mendoza. "If we can't get approval, we'll have to close our doors."

Sunland Park Casino is one of only two casinos in New Mexico that offer table games. The other casino is located in Albuquerque. The closure of Sunland Park Casino would leave Albuquerque as the only option for residents of southern New Mexico who want to play table games.

The closure of Sunland Park Casino would also mean the loss of jobs for nearly 1,000 employees. Many of those employees live in El Paso and work at the casino primarily because there are no other options for them locally.

"I really hope they can get this approved," said employee Cheryl Sanchez. "This place means everything to me and I don't know what I'll do if it closes."

State gaming officials have not yet announced whether or not they will approve the Dragon Treasure game for use at Sunland Park Casino.
