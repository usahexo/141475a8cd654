#  Saints leave scorched earth behind in dismantling of online casino with game red hot tamales!
I woke up on a beautiful sunny day in New Orleans. The Saints were scheduled to play the online casino Cleveland Browns later that day. I was feeling pretty good about the game. I mean, how could they not win with Drew Brees at quarterback?
The game started and it was all Saints. They were scoring touchdowns at will. The defense was playing great, and the online casino was looking hopeless. Then, in the fourth quarter, things got really interesting.
With the Saints up by 27 points, Cleveland scored a touchdown to make it a two-possession game. On the following drive, Brees threw an interception that gave Cleveland new life.
The online casino fans in the stands were going crazy. This was exactly the type of comeback they love to see. But then something amazing happened.
The Saints defense refused to let Cleveland score again. They held them on four consecutive plays from inside the 10-yard line to seal the victory.
It was a dominating performance by the Saints, and it left the online casino fans wondering what went wrong.
