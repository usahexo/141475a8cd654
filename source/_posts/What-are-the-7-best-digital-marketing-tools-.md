#  When should each tool be used?

Markdown is a great way to write for the web. It's simple, easy to learn, and can be read by humans and machines alike. HTML is a bit more complex, but it offers more control over how your content looks. So when should you use each tool?

If you're writing a short article or blog post, Markdown is the way to go. It's fast and easy to use, and most importantly, it's readable. When you need more control over how your content looks, switch to HTML. This will give you greater flexibility in terms of layout and design.

For longer pieces, such as essays or articles with multiple sections, Markdown may not be the best option. In this case, it's better to use HTML so you can organize your content more effectively.
