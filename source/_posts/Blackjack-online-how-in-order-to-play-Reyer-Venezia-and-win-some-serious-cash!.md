if you're looking to up your blackjack game, read on for some tips and tricks from reyer venezia!

#1 always split aces and eights

when you are dealt two aces or two eight cards, always split them. this will give you two new hands that you can play, increasing your chances of winning.

#2 never split fives or tens

although splitting aces and eights is always a good idea, splitting fives or tens is usually not worth it. these cards have a high value on their own and aren't worth splitting into two new hands.

#3 know when to hit and when to stand

this one may seem like common sense, but it's important to know when to hit and when to stand in order to make the best move possible. if you have 12 points total with two cards, for example, you would want to hit if the dealer has anything lower than 6 showing. on the other hand, if you have 16 points total with two cards, you would want to stand if the dealer has anything higher than 2 showing. use this chart as a guide when making your decisions:
