We’ll cover things like how to play, the different types of bets you can make, and some basic strategy tips. So whether you’re planning on playing Blackjack or Slots for the first time, or you want to up your game, read on for all the information you need.

#1 Roulette

Roulette is a classic casino game that is played by betting on numbers or colours. The aim of the game is to guess where the ball will land after spinning around a wheel divided into 36 compartments – 18 black and 18 red.

To play Roulette, first place your chips (or bet) on the table in the desired location. Then wait for the croupier to spin the ball in the opposite direction of the spinning wheel. When the ball comes to a stop, whichever number or colour it lands on determines the winner and payout (unless you have placed a bet on that number/colour).

There are a few different types of bets that you can place in Roulette: inside bets (on specific numbers), outside bets (on rows of numbers), column bets (on 12 consecutive numbers), and even/odd bets (betting that either an odd or even number will come up). There are also various other wagers that can be made such as pairing numbers or betting on black versus red. For a full list of all possible Roulette bets and their payouts, check out this article.

When playing Roulette, bear in mind that each bet has a different probability of winning – so if you want to maximise your chances of winning, it’s important to know which ones are favourable and which ones aren’t. For example, betting on black is more favourable than betting on red as there are 18 black slots as opposed to only 16 red ones. Similarly, betting on a single number is much harder than betting on a group of numbers (outside bet), as there is only a 1 in 36 chance of winning when betting on one number compared to a 1 in 18 chance when betting on three numbers simultaneously (a so-called ‘street bet’). For more information about Roulette odds and how they work, check out this guide.

Basic strategy for Roulette includes keeping track of what has already come up so as not to bet on those colours or numbers again; this is known as ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ numbers respectively. Additionally, trying not to split your bets between too many different options will give you a better chance of winning overall; known as ‘diversification’.

#2 Slot machines
Slot machines are perhaps one of the most popular casino games around – partly because they offer players big potential payouts if they hit the right combination! Slot machines work by spinning reels with symbols printed on them until they stop automatically (or when players hit the ‘spin’ button). If three or more matching symbols line up across any active win line(s), players win! Payouts vary depending on which symbol(s) line up and how many lines are being played across; but generally speaking, the bigger the payout, the rarer the symbol combination required will be.

Slot machines come in all shapes and sizes these days – from classic 3-reelers , all the way through to 5-reel video slots with loads of bonus features .
