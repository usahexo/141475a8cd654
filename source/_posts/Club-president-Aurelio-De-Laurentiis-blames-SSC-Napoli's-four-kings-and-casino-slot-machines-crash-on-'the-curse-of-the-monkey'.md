#  Club president Aurelio De Laurentiis blames SSC Napoli's four kings and casino slot machines crash on 'the curse of the monkey'

Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis has blamed the club's disappointing start to the season on "the curse of the monkey".

Speaking in an interview with Naples-based newspaper Il Mattino, De Laurentiis said he believed that a four-headed king statue which was brought into the club's training ground this summer had brought bad luck.

He also claimed that the recent crash of Napoli's casino slot machines was due to the curse.

"I am convinced that this is all down to the curse of the monkey," he said. "I have no other explanation.

"Ever since we installed that statue in our training ground, things have gone downhill. The players aren't playing well, we've had some bad luck with injuries and then the casino machines crashed. It all points to this cursed monkey."

De Laurentiis has now called for the statue to be removed from the training ground and destroyed.

"We need to get rid of this cursed monkey as soon as possible," he said. "It's not doing us any good and it's only bringing bad luck."

Napoli manager Maurizio Sarri says he's 'not worried' after club's four kings and casino slot machines crash.

The Naples-based side crashed out of the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday evening, losing to Spanish giants Real Madrid by a 5-0 aggregate scoreline.

But following their exit from Europe, Sarri has been forced to answer questions about his club's disappointing performance – as well as the reported mechanical faults which caused several of Napoli's casino slot machines and king icons to malfunction.

"I'm not worried," Sarri insisted in a press conference on Thursday. "These things can happen. We need to concentrate on Serie A now."

Asked if he felt his players had given up against Madrid, Sarri was unequivocal in his response. "No, absolutely not," he said. "We just weren't good enough on the night."

Napoli are currently second in Serie A, four points behind leaders Juventus. They face Chievo at home this weekend.

#  Napoli's failure to beat Atalanta sees them slip to fourth in Serie A after four kings and casino slot machines crash

Napoli 1-1 Atalanta

Napoli's 1-1 draw against Atalanta sees them drop to fourth in Serie A, their title challenge fading away after a disappointing result.

Dries Mertens gave Napoli the lead in the first half but they failed to hold onto it, crashing four kings and casino slot machines in the process.

Napoli boss Maurizio Sarri was unhappy with the result, insisting his side should have won the game: "We had enough chances to win three games, but at the end of the day we only took one point. "That's not enough. We have to start being more ruthless in front of goal."

Atalanta's equaliser came early in the second half through midfielder Bryan Cristante, who headed home from a corner.

Napoli are now six points behind leaders Juventus, who beat Roma 3-1 in Saturday's late game.

#  Napoli players vent their frustrations after fourth consecutive league game without a win, four kings and casino slot machines crash

Napoli's players were left venting their frustrations after the fourth consecutive league game without a win, which resulted in four kings and casino slot machines crashing.

Dries Mertens, Lorenzo Insigne, Marek Hamsik and Kalidou Koulibaly all spoke to Sky following the 3-1 home defeat to Atlanta.

"We're really angry, frustrated and disappointed," said Mertens. "It's not acceptable to lose like this at home. The fans deserve so much more and we're really sorry."

Insigne added: "We have to apologise to the fans. We didn't play well, we didn't do what we were supposed to do. We know that we can do better."

Hamsik was captain for the day in the absence of injured teammate Raul Albiol and said: "I don't know what's going on. We have to work harder and find solutions quickly. I'm very angry and very disappointed."

Koulibaly conceded it is now time for action: "We need to wake up. We've been sleeping for too long now. We have to find solutions quickly."

#  Could SSC Napoli's problems be down to their change of logo?

When Serie A club SSC Napoli unveiled their new logo earlier this year, it was met with mixed reactions. Some supporters praised the new design, while others criticised it for being too simplistic.

Now, just a few months later, there are suggestions that the club's poor form this season could be due to their change of logo. While it's impossible to say for certain whether or not this is the case, there are some compelling arguments in favour of this theory.

For a start, it's worth noting that Napoli have failed to win any of their last four league games – their worst run of form in over two years. What's more, they currently sit in sixth place in the Serie A table, nine points behind league leaders Juventus.

Some fans have argued that the new logo is to blame for Napoli's current struggles, as it has caused confusion among supporters and players alike. The new design is very different from the old one, which may have led to a lack of identification with the club amongst its fans.

Additionally, some commentators have suggested that the simplification of the logo might have made it harder for players to understand what the club stands for. This could be another reason why they have been performing so poorly recently.

While it's difficult to say for certain whether or not Napoli's new logo is responsible for their poor form, there is certainly some evidence to suggest that this could be the case. If the club fail to turn things around soon, they may need to consider reverting back to their old logo in order to improve their fortunes on the pitch.
