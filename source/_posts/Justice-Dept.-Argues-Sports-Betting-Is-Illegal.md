#  Justice Dept. Argues Sports Betting Is Illegal

The United States Department of Justice announced on Monday that it believes sports betting is illegal under the federal Wire Act, and thus interstate sports betting should be criminalized.

The announcement came in the form of a legal opinion requested by Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah. The Wire Act,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) passed in 1961, prohibits gambling businesses from using telecommunications systems to place bets.

Hatch had asked the DoJ to clarify the law’s reach following a 2011 decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which found that the Wire Act only applied to bets on sporting events between states. The Department of Justice now says that decision was wrong.

In a letter to Hatch, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim wrote that “the text, history, and purpose of the Wire Act show that Congress intended to prohibit all forms of betting on sports contests, not just bets placed through state-authorized telephonic communications.”

This is a reversal of the Obama administration’s position on the issue. In 2011, then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General James Cole issued a memo stating that while state-run sports lotteries were prohibited by the Wire Act, bets between individuals within states were legal.

Delrahim said in his letter that the Obama administration’s interpretation was wrong because it failed to give proper weight to Congress’s intent when it passed the Wire Act in 1961.

Hatch applauded the Department of Justice’s new interpretation in a statement released on Monday. “I have long argued that Congress intended to ban all forms of online gambling, and I applaud the Department of Justice for taking this step to correct its past interpretation of the Wire Act,” he said.

Opponents of legalizing sports betting argue that it is already possible for people in states where sports betting is illegal to bet with offshore online casinos and bookmakers. They say criminalizing interstate sports betting would only drive this business further underground.

Supporters argue that legalizing and regulating sports betting would bring much-needed revenue to state governments and would help protect consumers from being exploited by shady offshore operators.

#  Supreme Court To Hear New Jersey's Sports Betting Case

On Monday, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear New Jersey's appeal of a federal law banning most sports betting.

The state is arguing that the law, known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), violated the Tenth Amendment by forcing states to maintain laws against sports betting.

"This case is about more than just sports betting," said New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in a statement. "It is about the fundamental right of states to make their own decisions on matters of policy and morality."

Governor Christie has been a vocal advocate for legalizing sports betting in New Jersey, which has been pushing for the change since 2011. In anticipation of the Supreme Court's decision, the state has already passed legislation that would allow casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting.

The National Football League (NFL) and other professional sports leagues have argued against legalization, claiming that it would damage the integrity of their games. However, Governor Christie counters that current laws have done nothing to prevent illegal sports betting, which is estimated to be a $150 billion industry.

The Supreme Court is expected to hear oral arguments in the case in early 2018 and issue a ruling by June.

#  California Attorney General Files Lawsuit Against Fantasy Sports Sites

The California Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against three of the largest fantasy sports sites, including DraftKings and FanDuel. The lawsuit alleges that the sites are illegal gambling operations in violation of state law.

The attorney general's office released a statement saying that the sites are "illegal Internet gambling operations" that prey on unsuspecting consumers. The statement also said that the sites mislead players about the odds of winning and make false promises about how much money can be won.

DraftKings and FanDuel issued statements denying the allegations and insisting that their games are legal. They said they would fight to protect the interests of their customers.

This is not the first time that DraftKings and FanDuel have faced legal challenges. Last year, New York's attorney general filed a lawsuit against the two companies, alleging that they were engaged in illegal gambling. That case is still pending.

#  Nevada Attorney General Sues Maker Ofdaily Fantasy Sports Site

The Nevada Attorney General’s office has filed a lawsuit against the operators of a website that allows people to bet on the outcomes of simulated sporting events.

Attorney General Adam Laxalt said in a statement that the suit was filed against Boston-based DraftKings and New York-based FanDuel. The two companies, which have been engaged in a legal battle in several other states, announced a merger deal last month.

Laxalt’s office says in the lawsuit that the daily fantasy sports contests offered by the two companies are illegal gambling under Nevada law.

The lawsuit asks the court to stop DraftKings and FanDuel from offering their services in Nevada, to declare the games illegal gambling, and to order unspecified civil penalties against the companies.

DraftKings and FanDuel officials did not immediately respond Thursday to messages seeking comment.

#  U.S. Government Warns About Gambling Risks

The United States government has released warnings about the risks of gambling, stating that the activity can lead to financial losses, addiction, and other negative consequences.

“Gambling can have serious negative consequences for individuals, families, and society as a whole,” said a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). “It can cause financial losses, addiction, and a wide range of social problems.”

The warnings come as more states legalize gambling, including sports betting. Nevada was the first state to legalize casino gambling in 1931, and today there are casinos in 40 states. The legalization of sports betting is particularly controversial, as many believe that it will lead to widespread corruption in professional sports.

Despite the risks, some people continue to gamble despite the obvious dangers. According to a study by the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), 2 percent of American adults are addicted to gambling, while another 4-8 percent exhibit pathological gambling behavior. This means that approximately 6-10 million Americans are affected by problem gambling.

Gambling can have serious negative consequences for individuals, families, and society as a whole.

There are a number of reasons why gambling can be harmful. First and foremost, it can lead to financial losses. Gambling addicts often lose large sums of money, which can damage their finances and disrupt their lives. In addition, gambling can cause addiction and other social problems. Pathological gamblers often exhibit signs of addiction such as obsession, compulsion, and loss of control. They may also experience relationship problems or job losses as a result of their gambling habit.
